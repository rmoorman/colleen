To connect to the local *started* MySQL db in Sequel Pro:

Connect as standard

Name: localhost
Host: 127.0.0.1
Username: colleen
password: xxxxxx
database: zoon
port: whatever is default 


When running worker locally you need to run this query in MYSQL:
SET @@global.time_zone='+00:00';

If you don't have correct permissions to set the time zone, try this on the command line when logged in as root to mysql -->   $ mysql -u root):

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON zoon.* TO 'colleen'@'localhost' WITh GRANT OPTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR colleen@localhost = PASSWORD('galaxy');
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec) 

Then run the query: SET @@global.time_zone='+00:00';
