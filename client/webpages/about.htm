         <h1>We Need Us</h1>

         <p>‘We Need Us’ will be a real-time online animated artwork that explores big data. It concentrates on metadata which it draws from the activities of Zooniverse’s million+ participants, to create an ever-growing environment of sounds and animated forms. Unlike traditional data-visualisation which helps us understand and make sense of information from large data sets, ‘We Need Us’ explores the unique properties of the data itself. The work explores the distinct, living qualities and particular characteristics data might have, such as growth, velocity and fragility. Freeman asks us to consider what the meaning of data might be beyond its value-laden content. 'We Need Us' is a framework, a system, that exists in the knowledge that it will change when metadata flows through it in ways that are unpredictable and unknowable. It reminds us of the humanity in technology, and that we need ‘us’ as much as we need it.
         </p>
         <p>The work is being developed at the Open Data Institute and will be launched online and at an event in London in September 2014. Please sign up to the <a class="smoothscroll" href="#subscribe">newsletter</a> if you'd like us to keep you up-to-date with progress.
