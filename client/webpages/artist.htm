            <h3>The artist</h3>

            <p><a href="http://www.translatingnature.org">Julie Freeman</a> is an artist who uses complex processes and data from natural sources to create kinetic sculptures, physical objects, images, sound compositions and animations. Her work explores relationship between us, science and the natural world; questioning the use of technology in how we connect to, and translate, nature.
 
            Over the past 15 years, her work has been shown at leading institutions including: the V&amp;A, ICA, Kinetica, Barbican Centre, and the Science Museum, as well as internationally in Brazil, Croatia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Russia and the USA. Based in London, Julie is a <a href="http://ted.com">TED</a> Senior Fellow, a Nesta Fellow, and a doctoral student in Media &amp; Arts Technology at Queen Mary University of London. She leads the <a href="http://theodi.org/culture">Data as Culture</a> art programme at the Open Data Institute.
