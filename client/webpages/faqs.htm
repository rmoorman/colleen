	<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
	
	<p>We Need Us launched on 6th October 2014 on thespace.org - an online platform for digital art.</p>

<h3>What is an online animated artwork? </h3>
<p>An animation created by an artist, in this case Julie Freeman, that has been created specifically to be experienced and displayed online (on the Internet). We all spend large proportions of our time within the space of network which we access via screens, like our computers, tablets or mobile phones. Freeman's 'We Need Us' is public art for these 'spaces'.</p>

<h3>What’s the big idea behind ‘We Need Us’?</h3>
<p>‘We Need Us’ is like a thought experiment set up to reveal currently unknown ‘living’ qualities of data and metadata, if indeed these can be found. The work is research-led. It is unknown whether the artists' process will result in a definitive answer. Although we don't know exactly what we will find out about data through the project, we do know that the animated forms and sounds will act as powerful 'hooks' to help us consider the questions the artist is asking as we contemplate the movement and sound of the work, which are shaped and driven by real-time living data. It’s a way to ‘experience’ data.</p>

<h3>Why did Julie make it look the way it does?</h3>
<p>Digital data are essentially invisible. Julie chose to decide on initial shapes and forms for her animation that would both ‘carry’ and be altered by the constant flow of metadata feeding and shaping the work. She set rules for each formal ‘object’ in the work, including: there must only be quadrilaterals, angular, four-sided shapes, like the pixels that are behind all our screens; and only flat colours would be used. These are influenced, visually and sonically, by the data streams feeding the work from the online website Zooniverse.</p>
<p>In considering what forms she would construct Julie was highly influenced by the Russian early 20th century art movement, Suprematism, and in particular masters of the movement Malevich (now showing at Tate Modern until October 26th) and Popova.</p>

<h3>What about the sound?</h3>
<p>Most of the sounds in ‘We Need Us’ are environmental recordings, processed and manipulated just like the data. Like the visual aspect of the work, the sounds and the algorithmic rules that guide them are constructed by the artist, and the data influences the final composition.</p>

<h3>Why are artists interested in data?</h3>
<p>Many contemporary artists are interested in the political ramifications of data, particularly in the light of Edward Snowden's revelations and the related ongoing debates relating to the balance between national security and information privacy. Julie is interested in posing questions about data a world where we are increasingly preceded and tracked by our 'data shadows'.</p>

<h3>Is ‘We Need Us’ a data visualisation project?</h3>
<p>No. But Julie uses the visual and aural means of animation and constructed sounds to give some form to the data that will allow her to analyse patterns that have nothing to do with the actual information the data correspond to.</p>

<h3>Why is it interesting to explore metadata through We Need Us?</h3>
<p>Julie is looking at the frequency and activity of metadata generated by users of Zooniverse because it is a really fantastic example of open data that has the potential to give her enough variance for her to be able to identify patterns of behaviour and form in the data. It is also interesting because of all the political and personal ramifications of metadata. </p>

<h3>How does We Need Us’ relate to advances in contemporary science?</h3>
<p>Scientists use data to suggest possible truths and provide evidence about the way the world works. Researchers from Southampton, Oxford, and Edinburgh Universities working at the Social Machines project study the same Zooniverse data that powers ‘We Need Us’. They are examining how online collaborations are empowering communities to solve problems, without having to rely on remote experts or governments.</p>

<h3>How has Julie created the work technically? </h3>
<p>She takes the metadata from Zooniverse and counts the number of users and classifications happening every minute. She stores this in a new database as sets of values, while also recording the frequency of activity over an hour, a day and a month. These sets of values create rhythms that are translated into moving shapes, and play different banks of sounds. The live data ensures constant change and impermanence to the visual compositions Julie has created and the sounds she’s recorded. </p>

<h3>So what is ‘We Need Us’ again?</h3>
<p>‘We Need Us’ is an online artwork made with live data, animation and sound. Artist Julie Freeman is particularly excited by life data - which are real-time data from living things - and how we can use them to translate nature, generating new perspectives. She is interested both in how life data might be represented and in what ‘life’ raw data, as a material for art, might have on its own terms. For ‘We Need Us’ Freeman has created hand crafted algorithms, or bespoke computer code, to manipulate data taken from online activity within the Zooniverse website. Zooniverse enables anyone who logs into it to classify large scientific datasets about subjects such as astronomy and biology. With over a million users working together to analyse data, it is the world’s largest citizen science project. Julie’s code for ‘We Need Us’ captures, collects and exposes the real-time activity of Zooniverse users clicking and swiping online around the globe. In this way she is able to explore the real-time metadata (that is - data about data -) from Zooniverse. to perform for her in a way that starts to describe data in a very different way than simply as an analysing tool.</p>

<p>‘We Need Us’ asks questions about the purpose and nature of data, beyond their informational functions. Julie is interested in considering the specific qualities of open data and metadata once any ‘useful’ information that can be analysed and put to conclusive use has been discounted. The work appears as a mesmerising and thought-provoking animated environment with a multichannel soundtrack. The sounds and motion of the animated forms are generated by the Zooniverse data traffic. Julie’s ‘hand-crafted algorithms’ use the rhythms of the data which she argues start to describe the physical parameters and ‘sense of life’ of the data which would otherwise be invisible and incomprehensible.</p>


<h3>What are data?</h3>
<p>Facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.
Data have an astonishing ability to explain our world better, because they are so abundant and malleable. They advise us what to buy, log how far we travel and know all our friends. ‘Data’ can even ‘drive’ our cars.</p>

<h3>What is open data?</h3>
<p>Open data is information that is available for anyone to use, for any purpose, at no cost. The Open Data Institute’s <a href="http://www.theodi.org/faq" target="_blank">Open Data FAQ</a> have more information about open data.</p>


<h3>What's a data shadow?</h3>
<p>Techopedia states "is a slang term that refers to the sum of all small traces of information that an individual leaves behind through everyday activities. The piece of data created when an individual sends an email, updates and social media profile, swipes a credit card, uses an ATM and so on. The data shadow concept has become a serious concern, as it is difficult to control who actually looks at an individual data shadow, what conclusions they are drawing and what actions are taken based on those conclusions".</p>

<h3>What is meta data?</h3>
<p>Metadata is data that describes data, examples include the date and time you make a call, a library’s book index, the locations and names of all the weather stations that provide data for forecasting. Data shadows are made of metadata.</p>

<h3>What is Zooniverse?</h3>
<p>Zooniverse is the largest citizen science project in the world. Its website enables anyone to classify large scientific datasets about subjects such as astronomy and biology. It has over a million users working together to analyse data.
Zooniverse is one of the many social machines we decide to be part of everyday: socio-technical systems in which the human and technological elements play the role of participant components and contributors in the achievement of an objective, from capturing knowledge (Wikipedia) to networking (Twitter) or digitizing books and improving maps (reCAPTCHA).</p>
